# Image Classification with CNN on CIFAR-10

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning and model evaluation.

## Overview
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (60,000 images, 10 classes: airplane, cat, etc.).
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Matplotlib.
- **Objective**: Build and evaluate a CNN for image classification, achieving ~70% test accuracy.

## Files
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `train_model.py`: Script to train the CNN and save results.
- `accuracy_plot.png`: Plot of training and validation accuracy (generated by the script).
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the training script: `python train_model.py`
3. View the analysis: Open `analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. The dataset is automatically loaded via TensorFlow.

## Results
- Achieved ~70% test accuracy after 10 epochs.
- Used dropout and normalization to improve generalization.
- The `accuracy_plot.png` file is generated by the script.

## Notes
- This project showcases machine learning skills relevant to the IASD Masterâ€™s program, including neural network design and evaluation.
